# Ditiae Ex Machina

Wealth from the machine. A novel python based financial analysis tool.

## Ground Rules!

1. All variables should have proper naming and if necessary datatype suffixes that make sense (i.e. DataFrame: portfolio_df)
2. All code must be properly commented
3. All code must be properly logged with python logging.

## Testing!

All code must be rogorously tested and handle potential errors.
